# Backend side of sample of (Node, Redis, express, ws)
What is used in this repo is Node, Redis, express, ws, but I know more which is listed below.
<br/>
<br/>

These are the primary technologies I personally use dominantly and claim to know well.

#### backend tech tools :
* node/javascipt (express), 
* **Redis** (**<3**),
* other nosql databases (mongo, neo4j)
* sql databases (mysql), 
* python (pandas, ...data science libraries)

#### general software development tech tools : 
* version control (git), 
* package manager (npm, pip), 
* linux (ubuntu),
* command line (bash), 
* cloud computing (aws), 
* react app build tools (expo), 
* debugging (google devtools), 
* googling stuff and stack overflow (haha).

Things I’m being honest I DON’T know but I’d like to learn to be a better team player: testing (Jest), docker, webpack, ci.

fun fact, editor of choice is *VSCode not just for the intellisense but also because VSCode + VSCode ssh extension + EC2 + Expo + React Native + Nodemon + Websockets + Redis = Real-Time apps with Real-Time development.

#### above this line that's the general gist 
---
#### below this line is more specific and just meant to signify I know a good majority of these objects, methods, and properties in the API comprehensively

Javascript (*ES6 ( *promises (async/await), *modules (import/export), *block scoped variables (let/const), *arrow functions, ) *control loops (if/else, for, while, ect…), *primitive objects / data types (strings, arrays, ect…, but not symbol (who even uses that?)), standard objects (*date, *json, *regexp, *math, number, ), *network (*fetch, ws), **boolean operators (==><||&&:), error handling (try/catch), )

*Node ( *NPM :), many npm packages such as (*uuid, *ws, *cors, d3, … ), core Node.js API (*json, events, buffers, streams, file system, path, url, http) *Express, *json,)


*React (*functional components, *hooks (state, effect, context, ref),
**React Native (*most every native component, starting to explore and learn third party components like maps, video, react navigation) 
*HTML/*CSS (duh)
<br/>
**Redis (beautiful)

For sake of time don’t need to do this anymore in depth as someone reading my code would be able to decipher my level of expertise with most of these tech tools / APIs.
